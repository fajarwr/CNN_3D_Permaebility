# CNN_3D_Permaebility
This study aims to predict the permeability value using a machine learning convolutional neural network (CNN) in a sandstone sample. The stages of this research in general are making sandstone subsample, permeability calculation using the Kozeny-Carman equation as a reference permeability value, training process and tuning CNN parameters so that the best CNN architecture is obtained, the last last is validation process or testing process with reference permeability values to evaluate the model that already made.

In this respository, I just show final architecture that have best acuracy.
To try the code, open CNN_3D_Permeability_All.ipynb in Google Colabolatory.
