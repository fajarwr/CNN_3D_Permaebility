# CNN_3D_Permaebility
This study aims to predict the permeability value using a machine learning convolutional neural network (CNN) in a sandstone sample.
In this respository, I just show final architecture that have best acuracy.
To try the code, open CNN_3D_Permeability_All.ipynb in Google Colabolatory.
The data can be accesed in bit.ly/Berea_Sandstone
